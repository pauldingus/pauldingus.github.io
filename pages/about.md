# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,

I'm an engineer and data scientist turned policy wonk. I've worked in batteries, solar energy, and politics. Most recently, I've been bringing more tech talent to the civic space through [Bluebonnet Data](www.bluebonnetdata.org), and studying at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/).

I'm interested in building research-to-policy pipelines, particularly in areas that concern economics, fiscal policy, climate, and energy. Particularly, I'm curious how the use of satellite data and other big geographic data can inform economic and climate policy.
