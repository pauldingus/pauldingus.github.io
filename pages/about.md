# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm an engineer and data scientist turned policy wonk. I've worked in batteries, solar energy, and politics. Most recently, I've been bringing more tech talent to the civic space throuhg [Bluebonnet Data](www.bluebonnetdata.org), and studying at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/).

I'm highly interested in building research-to-policy pipelines, particularly in areas that concern economics, fiscal policy, climate, and energy.
