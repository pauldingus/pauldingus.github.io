# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,

I'm an engineer and data scientist turned policy wonk. I've worked in batteries, solar energy, and politics. Most recently, I've been bringing more tech talent to the civic space through [Bluebonnet Data](www.bluebonnetdata.org), and studying at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/). I'm currently working at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability developing the [Marketplace Activity Index](https://www.su.se/english/research/research-projects/the-marketplace-activity-index?open-collapse-boxes=research-project-members).

I'm interested in building research-to-policy pipelines, particularly in areas that concern economics, AI, sustainability, and energy.
