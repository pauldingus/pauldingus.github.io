# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,

I'm an engineer and data scientist turned policy wonk. I've worked in batteries, solar energy, and politics. Most recently, I've been bringing more tech talent to the civic space throuhg [Bluebonnet Data](www.bluebonnetdata.org), and studying at the [Harvard Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/).

I'm highly interested in building research-to-policy pipelines, particularly in areas that concern economics, fiscal policy, climate, and energy. Right now, I'm particularly interested in the use of satellite data and other big data to inform economic policy.
