Monitoring and preventing tropical deforestation is key to mitigating climate change, as it accounts for 10% of global GHG emissions. Satellite data can help monitor land use changes around the world. With decreasing acquisition costs, access to satellite data has been made increasingly readily available. In this project, I demonstrate the entire data pipeline that can enable real-time deforestation monitoring via publicly-available satellite data.
