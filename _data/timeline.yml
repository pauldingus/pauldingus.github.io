- title: Masters in Public Policy, Harvard Kennedy School
  from: 2021
  to: 2023
  description: At HKS, I focused on bridging the gap between data science and policy action. I studied analytical methods, finance, and economics. 
               I took courses in urban economics, energy and environmental economics, public finance, macroeconomics, and market failures. For my thesis, 
               I worked with Transport for London, proposing a flood cost modeling system for the London Underground to underpin climate adaptation investment.

- title: Summer Fellow, Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative
  from: 2022
  to: 2022
  description: I spend the summer of 2022 in Pretoria, South Africa advising the Mayor and his team on data-driven strategy, with a particular focus on increasing
               the efficiency of municipal water delivery. I worked across several city departments, collecting and merging data that pertained to the water system, 
               assembling analyses and reports, and (most importantly) assembling a supportive coalition to enable action. 

- title: Founder and Technical Director, Bluebonnet Data
  from: 2018
  to: 2021
  description: Bluebonnet Data started out as a group of political data nerds 
               volunteering for handful progressive campaigns. Now it is is a national nonprofit with a 
               mission to democratize data. We recruit, train, and organize people with skills in coding and data science 
               to volunteer on data analyst teams for progressive campaigns and causes. I co-founded Bluebonnet, 
               stepping in as Bluebonnet's Technical Director and employee number two in 2018, growing the organization from a 
               dozen volunteer teams to more than 300 over the course of a year. I led the creation of Bluebonnet's technical infrastructure,
               training programs, knowledge management systems, and all internal programs and resources. Building an 
               organization like Bluebonnet was the experience of a lifetime, and taught me more than I could have imagined about 
               organizational management, political and demographic data work, and entrepreneurship. I am still involved as a 
               volunteer and board member.
