- title: Founder and Technical Director, Bluebonnet Data
  from: 2018
  to: 2021
  description: Bluebonnet Data started out as a group of political data nerds 
               volunteering for handful progressive campaigns. Now it is is a national nonprofit with a 
               mission to democratize data. We recruit, train, and organize people with skills in coding and data science 
               to volunteer on data analyst teams for progressive campaigns and causes. I co-founded Bluebonnet, 
               stepping in as Bluebonnet's Technical Director and employee number two in 2018, growing the organization from a 
               dozen volunteer teams to more than 300 over the course of a year. I led the creation of Bluebonnet's technical infrastructure,
               training programs, knowledge management systems, and all internal programs and resources. Building an 
               organization like Bluebonnet was the experience of a lifetime, and taught me more than I could have imagined about 
               organizational management, political and demographic data work, and entrepreneurship. I am still involved as a 
               volunteer and board member.
